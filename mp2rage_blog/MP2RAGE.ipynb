    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains everything needed to reproduce the MP2RAGE T<sub>1</sub> blog post on the [qMRLab website](). In fact, this notebook generated the HTML for the blog post too! This notebook is currently running on a MyBinder server that only you can access, but if you want to be kept up-to-date on any changes that the developpers make to this notebook, you should go to it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qMRLab/t1_notebooks) and follow it by clicking the \"Watch\" button in the top right (you may need to create a GitHub account, if you don't have one already).\n",

    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a few things you can do in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "* Run the entire processing by clicking above on the \"Kernel\" tab, then \"Restart & Run All\". It will be complete when none of the cells have an asterix \"\\*\" in the square brackets.\n",
    "* To change the code, you need to click once on code cells. To re-run that cell, click the \"Run\" button above when the cell is selected.\n",
    "  * **Note:** Cells can depend on previous cells, or even on previous runs of the cell itself, so it's best to run all the previous cells beforehand.\n",
    "* This binder runs on SoS, which allows the mixing of Octave (i.e. an open-source MATLAB) and Python cells. Take a look a the drop down menu on the top right of the cells to know which one you are running.\n",
    "* To transfer data from cells of one language to another, you need to create a new cell in the incoming language and run `%get (param name) --from (outgoing language)`. See cells below for several examples within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML\n",
    "* To reproduce the HTML of the blog post, run the entire processing pipeline (see point one in the previous section), then save the notebook (save icon, top left). Now, click on the drop down menu on the left pannel, and select `%sossave --to html --force` . After a few seconds, it should output \"Workflow saved to VariableFlipAngle.html\" – click on the HTML name, and you're done!\n",
    "* Cells with tags called \"scratch\" are not displayed in the generated HTML.\n",
    "* Cells with the tag \"report_output\" display the output (e.g. figures) in the generated HTML.\n",
    "* Currently in an un-run notebook, the HTML is not formatted like the website. To do so, run the Python module import cell (`# Module imports`) and then very last cell (`display(HTML(...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have any other questions or comments, please raise them in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qMRLab/t1_notebooks/issues).**\n",

    "Dictionary-based MRI techniques capable of generating T<sub>1</sub> maps are increasing in popularity, due to their growing availability on clinical scanners, rapid scan times, and fast post-processing computation time, thus making quantitative T<sub>1</sub> mapping accessible for clinical applications. Generally speaking, dictionary-based quantitative MRI techniques use numerical dictionaries—databases of pre-calculated signal values simulated for a wide range of tissue and protocol combinations—during the image reconstruction or post-processing stages. Popular examples of dictionary-based techniques that have been applied to T<sub>1</sub> mapping are MR Fingerprinting (MRF) (Ma et al. 2013), certain flavours of compressed sensing (CS) (Doneva et al. 2010; Li et al. 2012), and Magnetization Prepared 2 Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echoes (MP2RAGE) (Marques et al. 2010). Dictionary-based techniques can usually be classified into one of two categories: techniques that use information redundancy from parametric data to assist in accelerated imaging (e.g. CS, MRF), or those that use dictionaries to estimate quantitative maps using the MR images after reconstruction. Because MP2RAGE is a technique implemented primarily for T<sub>1</sub> mapping, and it is becoming increasingly available as a standard pulse sequence on many MRI systems, the remainder of this section will focus solely on this technique. However, many concepts discussed are shared by other dictionary-based techniques.\n",

    "MP2RAGE is an extension of the conventional MPRAGE pulse sequence widely used in clinical studies (Haase et al. 1989; Mugler & Brookeman 1990). A simplified version of the MP2RAGE pulse sequence is shown in Figure 1. MP2RAGE can be seen as a hybrid between the inversion recovery and VFA pulse sequences: a 180° inversion pulse is used to prepare the magnetization for T<sub>1</sub> sensitivity at the beginning of each TRMP2RAGE, and then two images are acquired at different inversion times using gradient recalled echo (GRE) imaging blocks with low flip angles and short repetition times (TR). During a given GRE imaging block, each excitation pulse is followed by a constant in-plane (“y”) phase encode weighting (varied for each TRMP2RAGE), but with different 3D (“z”) phase encoding gradients (varied at each TR). The center of k-space for the 3D phase encoding direction is acquired at the TI for each GRE imaging block. The main motivation for developing the MP2RAGE pulse sequence was to provide a metric similar to MPRAGE, but with self-bias correction of the static (B<sub>0</sub>) and receive (B<sub>1</sub><sup>-</sup>) magnetic fields, and a first order correction of the transmit magnetic field (B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>). However, because two images at different TIs are acquired (unlike MPRAGE, which only acquires data at a single TI), information about the T<sub>1</sub> values can also be inferred, thus making it possible to generate quantitative T<sub>1</sub> maps using this data.\n",

    "Because MP2RAGE is a hybrid of pulse sequences used for inversion recovery and VFA, the resulting signal equations are more complex. Typically, a steady state is not achieved during the short train of GRE imaging blocks, so the signal at the center of k-space for each readout (which defines the contrast weighting) will depend on the number of phase-encoding steps. For simplicity, the equations presented here assume that the 3D phase-encoding dimension is fully sampled (no partial Fourier or parallel imaging acceleration). For this case (see appendix of (Marques et al. 2010) for derivation details), the signal equations are:\n",

    "To produce T<sub>1</sub> maps with good accuracy and precision using dictionary-based interpolation methods, it is important that the signal curves are unique for each parameter value. MP2RAGE can produce good T<sub>1</sub> maps by using a dictionary with only dimensions (T<sub>1</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>MP2RAGE</sub>), since <i>S</i><sub>MP2RAGE</sub> is unique for each T<sub>1</sub> value for a given protocol  (Marques et al. 2010). However, as was noted above, <i>S</i><sub>MP2RAGE</sub> is also sensitive to B<sub>1</sub> because of <i>θ<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>θ<sub>2</sub></i> in Eqs. (1.13–1.16). The  B<sub>1</sub>-sensitivity can be reduced substantially with careful MP2RAGE protocol optimization (Marques et al. 2010), and further improved by including B<sub>1</sub> as one of the dictionary dimensions [T<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>MP2RAGE</sub>] (Figure 1.15).  This requires an additional acquisition of a B<sub>1</sub> map (Marques & Gruetter 2013), which lengthens the scan time. \n",

    "This widespread availability and its turnkey acquisition/fitting procedures are a main contributing factor to the growing interest for including quantitative T<sub>1</sub> maps in clinical and neuroscience studies. T<sub>1</sub> values measured using MP2RAGE showed  high levels of reproducibility for the brain in an inter- and intra-site study at eight sites (same MRI hardware/software and at 7 T) of two subjects (Voelker et al. 2016). Not only does MP2RAGE have one of the fastest acquisition and post-processing times among quantitative T<sub>1</sub> mapping techniques, but it can accomplish this while acquiring very high resolution T<sub>1</sub> maps (1 mm isotropic at 3T and submillimeter at 7T, both in under 10 min (Fujimoto et al. 2014)), opening the doors to cortical studies which greatly benefit from the smaller voxel size (Waehnert et al. 2014; Beck et al. 2018; Haast et al. 2018).\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Despite these benefits, MP2RAGE and similar dictionary-based techniques have certain limitations that are important to consider before deciding to incorporate them in a study. Good reproducibility of the quantitative T<sub>1</sub> map is dependent on using one pre-calculated dictionary. If two different dictionaries are used (e.g. cross-site with different MRI vendors), the differences in the dictionary interpolations will likely result in minor differences in T<sub>1</sub> estimates for the same data. Also, although the B1-sensitivity of the MP2RAGE T<sub>1</sub> maps can be reduced with proper protocol optimization, it can be substantial enough that further correction using a measured B<sub>1</sub> map should be done (Marques & Gruetter 2013; Haast et al. 2018). However B<sub>1</sub> mapping brings an additional potential source of error, so carefully selecting a B<sub>1</sub> mapping technique and accompanying post-processing method (e.g. filtering) should be done before integrating it in a T<sub>1</sub> mapping protocol (Boudreau et al. 2017). Lastly, the MP2RAGE equations (and thus, dictionaries) assume monoexponential longitudinal relaxation, and this has been shown to result in suboptimal estimates of the long T<sub>1</sub> component for a biexponential relaxation model (Rioux et al. 2016), an effect that becomes more important at higher fields.\n",

    "A previous version of this text incorrectly stated the equations for TB and TC. They were written as TB = TI<sub>2</sub> - TI<sub>1</sub> + (n/2)TR and TC = TR<sub>MP2RAGE</sub> - TI<sub>2</sub> + (n/2)TR, whereas they should have been TB = TI<sub>2</sub> - (TI<sub>1</sub> + nTR) and TC = TR<sub>MP2RAGE</sub> - (TI<sub>2</sub> + (n/2)TR). This has been corrected in the text.
