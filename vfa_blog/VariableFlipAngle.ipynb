    "# Welcome to a qMRLab interactive blog post Jupyter Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time running a Juptyer Notebook, there's a lot of tutorials available online to help. [Here's one](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) for your convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains everything needed to reproduce the Variable Flip Angle T<sub>1</sub> blog post on the [qMRLab website](). In fact, this notebook generated the HTML for the blog post too! This notebook is currently running on a MyBinder server that only you can access, but if you want to be kept up-to-date on any changes that the developpers make to this notebook, you should go to it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qMRLab/t1_notebooks) and follow it by clicking the \"Watch\" button in the top right (you may need to create a GitHub account, if you don't have one already).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a few things you can do in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "* Run the entire processing by clicking above on the \"Kernel\" tab, then \"Restart & Run All\". It will be complete when none of the cells have an asterix \"\\*\" in the square brackets.\n",
    "* To change the code, you need to click once on code cells. To re-run that cell, click the \"Run\" button above when the cell is selected.\n",
    "  * **Note:** Cells can depend on previous cells, or even on previous runs of the cell itself, so it's best to run all the previous cells beforehand.\n",
    "* This binder runs on SoS, which allows the mixing of Octave (i.e. an open-source MATLAB) and Python cells. Take a look a the drop down menu on the top right of the cells to know which one you are running.\n",
    "* To transfer data from cells of one language to another, you need to create a new cell in the incoming language and run `%get (param name) --from (outgoing language)`. See cells below for several examples within this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML\n",
    "* To reproduce the HTML of the blog post, run the entire processing pipeline (see point one in the previous section), then save the notebook (save icon, top left). Now, click on the drop down menu on the left pannel, and select `%sossave --to html --force` . After a few seconds, it should output \"Workflow saved to VariableFlipAngle.html\" – click on the HTML name, and you're done!\n",
    "* Cells with tags called \"scratch\" are not displayed in the generated HTML.\n",
    "* Cells with the tag \"report_output\" display the output (e.g. figures) in the generated HTML.\n",
    "* Currently in an un-run notebook, the HTML is not formatted like the website. To do so, run the Python module import cell (`# Module imports`) and then very last cell (`display(HTML(...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have any other questions or comments, please raise them in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/qMRLab/t1_notebooks/issues).**"

    "Variable flip angle (VFA) T<sub>1</sub> mapping (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977; Fram et al. 1987), also known as Driven Equilibrium Single Pulse Observation of T<sub>1</sub> (DESPOT1) (Homer & Beevers 1985; Deoni et al. 2003), is a rapid quantitative T<sub>1</sub> measurement technique that is widely used to acquire 3D T<sub>1</sub> maps (e.g. whole-brain) in a clinically feasible time. VFA estimates T<sub>1</sub> values by acquiring multiple spoiled gradient echo acquisitions, each with different excitation flip angles (<i>θ<sub>n</sub></i> for n = 1, 2, .., N and <i>θ<sub>i</sub></i> ≠ <i>θ<sub>j</sub></i>). The steady-state signal of this pulse sequence (Figure 1) uses very short TRs (on the order of magnitude of 10 ms) and is very sensitive to T<sub>1</sub> for a wide range of flip angles.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "VFA is a technique that originates from the NMR field, and was adopted because of its time efficiency and the ability to acquire accurate T<sub>1</sub> values simultaneously for a wide range of values (Christensen et al. 1974; Gupta 1977). For imaging applications, VFA also benefits from an increase in SNR because it can be acquired using a 3D acquisition instead of multislice, which also helps to reduce slice profile effects. One important drawback of VFA for T<sub>1</sub> mapping is that the signal is very sensitive to inaccuracies in the flip angle value, thus impacting the T<sub>1</sub> estimates.  In practice, the nominal flip angle (i.e. the value set at the scanner) is different than the actual flip angle experienced by the spins (e.g. at 3.0 T, variations of up to ±30%), an issue that increases with field strength. VFA typically requires the acquisition of another quantitative map, the transmit RF amplitude (B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>, or B<sub>1</sub> for short), to calibrate the nominal flip angle to its actual value because of B<sub>1</sub> inhomogeneities that occur in most loaded MRI coils (Sled & Pike 1998). The need to acquire an additional B<sub>1</sub> map reduces the time savings offered by VFA over saturation-recovery techniques, and inaccuracies/imprecisions of the B<sub>1</sub> map are also propagated into the VFA T<sub>1</sub> map (Boudreau et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2017).\n",

    "The closed-form solution (Equation 1) makes several assumptions which in practice may not always hold true if care is not taken. Mainly, it is assumed that the longitudinal magnetization has reached a steady state after a large number of TRs, and that the transverse magnetization is perfectly spoiled at the end of each TR. Bloch simulations – a numerical approach at solving the Bloch <i>equations</i> for a set of spins at each time point –  provide a more realistic estimate of the signal if the number of repetition times is small (i.e. a steady-state is not achieved). As can be seen from Figure 3, the number of repetitions required to reach a steady state not only depends on T<sub>1</sub>, but also on the flip angle; flip angles near the Ernst angle need more TRs to reach a steady state. Preparation pulses or an outward-in k-space acquisition pattern are typically sufficient to reach a steady state by the time that the center of k-space is acquired, which is where most of the image contrast resides.\n",

    "There are two important imaging protocol design considerations that should be taken into account when planning to use VFA: (1) how many and which flip angles to use to acquire VFA data, and (2) correcting inaccurate flip angles due to transmit RF field inhomogeneity. Most VFA experiments use the minimum number of required flip angles (two) to minimize acquisition time. For this case, it has been shown that the flip angle choice resulting in the best precision for VFA T<sub>1</sub> estimates for a sample with a single T<sub>1</sub> value (i.e. single tissue) are the two flip angles that result in 71% of the maximum possible steady-state signal (i.e. at the Ernst angle) (Deoni et al. 2003; Schabel & Morrell 2009).\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Time allowing, additional flip angles are often acquired at higher values and in between the two above, because greater signal differences between tissue T<sub>1</sub> values are present there (e.g. Figure 2). Also, for more than two flip angles, Equations 1 and 4 do not have the same noise weighting for each fitting point, which may bias linear least-square T<sub>1</sub> estimates at lower SNRs. Thus, it has been recommended that low SNR data should be fitted with either Equation 1 using non-linear least-squares (slower fitting) or with a weighted linear least-squares form of Equation 4 (Chang et al. 2008).\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Accurate knowledge of the flip angle values is very important to produce accurate T<sub>1</sub> maps. Because of how the RF field interacts with matter (Sled & Pike 1998), the excitation RF field (B<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>, or B<sub>1</sub> for short) of a loaded RF coil results in spatial variations in intensity/amplitude, unless RF shimming is available to counteract this effect (not common at clinical field strengths). For quantitative measurements like VFA which are sensitive to this parameter, the flip angle can be corrected (voxelwise) relative to the nominal value by multiplying it with a scaling factor (B<sub>1</sub>) from a B<sub>1</sub> map that is acquired during the same session:\n",

    "B<sub>1</sub> in this context is normalized, meaning that it is unitless and has a value of 1 in voxels where the RF field has the expected amplitude (i.e. where the nominal flip angle is the actual flip angle). Figure 6 displays fitted VFA T<sub>1</sub> values from a Monte Carlo dataset simulated using biased flip angle values, and fitted without/with B<sub>1</sub> correction.\n",

Simulation parameters: TR = 25 ms, T<sub>1</sub> = 900 ms, <i>θ<sub>nominal</sub></i> = 6° and 32° (optimized values for this TR/T<sub>1</sub> combination). Notice how even after B<sub>1</sub> correction, fitted T<sub>1</sub> values at B<sub>1</sub> values far from the nominal case (B<sub>1</sub> = 1) exhibit larger variance, as the actual flip angles of the simulated signal deviate from the optimal values for this TR/T<sub>1</sub> (Deoni et al. 2003).\n",

    "It has been well reported in recent years that the accuracy of VFA T<sub>1</sub> estimates is very sensitive to pulse sequence implementations (Stikov et al. 2015; Lutti & Weiskopf 2013; Baudrexel et al. 2018), and as such is less robust than the gold standard inversion recovery technique. In particular, the signal bias resulting from insufficient spoiling can result in inaccurate T<sub>1</sub> estimates of up to 30% relative to inversion recovery estimated values (Stikov et al. 2015). VFA T<sub>1</sub> map accuracy and precision is also strongly dependent on the quality of the measured B<sub>1</sub> map (Lee et al. 2017), which can vary substantially between implementations (Boudreau et al. 2017). Modern rapid B<sub>1</sub> mapping pulse sequences are not as widely available as VFA, resulting in some groups attempting alternative ways of removing the bias from the T<sub>1</sub> maps like generating an artificial B<sub>1</sub> map through the use of image processing techniques (Liberman et al. 2014) or omitting B<sub>1</sub> correction altogether (Yuan et al. 2012). The latter is not recommended, because most MRI scanners have default pulse sequences that, with careful protocol settings, can provide B<sub>1</sub> maps of sufficient quality very rapidly (Boudreau et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2005; Samson et al. 2006).\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Despite some drawbacks, VFA is still one of the most widely used T<sub>1</sub> mapping methods in research. Its rapid acquisition time, rapid image processing time, and widespread availability makes it a great candidate for use in other quantitative imaging acquisition protocols like quantitative magnetization transfer imaging (Yarnykh 2002; Cercignani et al. 2005) and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging (Sung et al. 2013; Li et al. 2018).\n",
